The next day Ian walks toward the park with Ben so they can play basketball. As they approach, they see a large crowd and a dozen emergency vehicles. Ben hurries to the nearest spectator and asks what’s happening. The woman tells them that there’s a lost child, a 3-year-old boy named Aiden who wandered away from his mother while at the playground. As she’s speaking to them, another woman, this one in uniform and speaking through a bullhorn, starts giving instructions for searching--stay in a line, no more than 10 feet from the person next to you, stop frequently to call and listen for Aiden.

Ian and Ben look at each other and shrug. Ben puts the basketball down where they stand and they both jog over to one of the group leaders. As they’re searching, Ben keeps hissing at Ian. He’s not particularly good at following the directions since he’s conducting a search of his own. After less than ten minutes of searching, Ian sees the boy. He looks like he's sleeping. Ian hopes that he's sleeping. He’s underground, several feet downstream of a storm drain.

It’s time for the group to stop and call and when they do, even though Aiden is silent, Ian shouts out, “I heard something!”

None of the others, all adults, hear anything and they give him a doubting look. Ian calls out the boy’s name again and then says, “Did you hear that?” He looks pleadingly at Ben who replies, “Uh...yeah. Me too. I hear crying...maybe.”

The adults, agreeing that the teens probably have better hearing than they do, follow the boys as they jog to the storm drain. They both lie down on the ground and start shouting into the drain. Ian can see the boy clearly, but pulls up the flashlight on his phone and starts shining it in the direction of the boy. He whispers to Ben, “He’s unconscious or asleep at least. Can you see him?” Ben adds his own flashlight to the effort, but shakes his head.

They stand up and some of the adults take their place alternately calling and listening for a response. The group leader is on the walkie, calling rescue crews to their location. Ian is getting nervous, “We have to wake him up so someone can actually hear him when they get here.”

“Ian,” Ben whispers back, “Are you sure he’s there? I mean, maybe we should just keep moving in our line. We can get in some serious trouble for being the ‘boys who cried wolf’”.

Ian looks back at him wide-eyed, “You think I’m faking it? You said you believed me. I proved to you what I can do!” Ian walks away and back toward the drain. The adults in the crew have continued calling and listening although they seem to be a bit discouraged. One of them looks up at him and raises his eyebrows. Ian gets down on the ground again and squeezes as far into the drain as he can. He takes a deep breath and screams, not even trying to say the boy’s name, just trying to make as much noise as he possibly can.

Miraculously, it works. The boy is startled awake and begins to cry for real. At first it’s just a whimper, but when he realizes that he’s still in the dark and this isn’t a nightmare, he starts to sob. Someone pats him on the back. He pulls himself out of the drain. Everyone can hear Aiden now and the rescue crew is just arriving.

Looking around the room, the observers dutifully checked and circled; the tips of their pens scratching in their notebooks. They wore lab coats, although the room they were in could hardly be called a lab. It looked like a school--a nursery school, really. There were nearly 30 children in the room--infants, toddlers, a few as old as 5--who played the way children do with determination and concentration. A teacher walked over to a child and clicked a small device. A small boy immediately looked up at the blank page the teacher was holding and said, “elephant.” The teacher gave a nod and the child returned to play, while the observers furiously wrote in their notepads. Another teacher walked toward a pair of girls, perhaps three years old and identical except for the numbers on the backs of their shirts. When she was several feet away, she clicked her device. This one, however, made no noise. The girl labeled 810 looked up immediately and when she noticed her sister had not, gave a small kick under the table. The teacher gave both girls a nod. She hadn't seen the kick. The observers, however, had.

Days pass and nothing really changes, except that Ian is now expecting the visions, so is able to avoid freaking out or attracting attention. He still sees the Nia clone following him, but she never gets too close, and he doesn’t do anything to let her know that he has seen her. 

One night, after their parents have disappeared into their office with their takeout dinner, Nia and Ian are sitting at the kitchen table filling their plates with Chinese food. Nia asks Ian, “How are you doing? You’ve been stranger this past week.”

Ian snorts, “A stranger?”

“Not A stranger. Stranger. I mean, you’re always strange, but lately you’ve been stranger. Is everything okay?”

Ian takes a huge bite of food, so he can delay answering for a bit. As he chews, Nia just watches him, waiting for him to start talking. Ian swallows and then quietly, in case their parents are listening, tells Nia what’s been happening. Unlike with Ben, he leaves nothing out. Nia’s expression goes from confused, to doubtful, to incredulous, to scared that her brother had gone off the deep end.
She takes a deep breath, “No joke?” It’s the only thing she needs to say. The twins are both known for having a little fun sometimes, but this is their way of cutting through everything.

“No joke,” Ian replies solemnly. “I wish it was.”

“Did something happen? Did you get hit in the head or something? Are you sure you’re seeing through things and not just hallucinating?” 

“I’m sure. I’ve tested myself dozens of times over the past week. Go ahead, ask me anything.”

Nia stands up from the table, wipes her sweating palms on her legs, and steps into the pantry. She closes the door and picks up a bottle of soda.

“Don’t drink my orange,” Ian chides, “Stick with your gross ginger ale.” Nia nearly drops the bottle, but manages to put it back on the shelf. Without saying a word, she picks up a box of protein bars. “Grab the peanut butter ones,” Ian says, “Cranberry almond is gross.” Nia opens the door, without putting the box down and walks over to her brother. 

She puts her arms around him and whisper-screams, “This is so cool! Oh my gosh! Does anyone else know about this?” Ian hugs her back...a look of relief on his face for a moment. Soon, the concern is back. 

“Is it? Is it cool? Nia, what if I have a brain tumor or something?”

“Well, we can tell Mom and Dad. You can get a scan, but why would you want to get rid of something cool like this?” She’s quiet for a moment. “Hey! We’re twins. Maybe it’s going to happen to me, too!” She walks over to the closed pantry door and stares and squints, trying to see through the door the way Ian had. “Nothing.”

Ian reminds her that it started with being able to see really small things really far away. He points to a box of cereal on the counter and asks her if she can read the ingredients. Again, she squints and stares, but with no luck. Ian then looks at the school calendar on the cork board and sees that there’s a choir concert on the 16th. He asks Nia if she can read it. She follows his eyeline and looks at the calendar. She doesn't see it really, but she sort of sees something in her head and tells him. 

“That’s right!” Ian says with excitement. After all, if Nia can do this too, then it probably isn’t a brain tumor. They test each other for another hour. Ian gets everything right, but Nia is hit or miss. They try, but can’t pinpoint the reason that Nia’s results are inconsistent.

They decide to call it a night. In the morning, Ian wakes with a start. He heads for Nia’s room...possibly the first time ever that he’s been awake before her. He shakes her awake, she sits up in bed and stares at him. She gestures to him to tell her what’s up.

“Do you think it’s just us? I mean, Bill and Pam aren’t our real parents. Maybe our real parents know something about this. I’m going to go into the office. See what I can find.”

Nia grabs his arm before he can move and cautions, “You can’t go in there. They never leave.”

Ian points to his eyes with his two fingers, then points at the floor and says, “Oh, I’m going.” He steps to an empty spot on Nia’s floor, sits, and directs his gaze downward. As he stares at the floor, it disappears, weirding him out for a moment, and making him push backward. He settles again and looks down at Bill and Pam. He can see them sitting at their computers. Pam is playing solitaire and Bill is playing some sort of online game. Ian watches for a while, but nothing changes. “They’re playing games,” He tells Nia. "There’s nothing to see. I’ll have to try again another time.”

The next evening, Ian sits in Nia’s room and stares at the floor. The office is pretty much empty. Two desks, two computers, two parents. That’s it. Except for a couple of boxes that are stacked in the corner. 

“So,” Nia interrupts his watching, “I thought I might sleep at some point tonight. Can you go?”

“I can watch while you sleep. I don’t need the light.”

Nia sighs, “That’s not really the point. I’d like my room to myself.”

“Nia, I have to figure out what’s in those boxes. I can see through the boxes, but I don’t even know what I’m looking at in the top one and the bottom one is just a bunch of papers and they’re too close together to read.” Ian stands up from his spot on the floor and sits on the edge of the bed. “Should we try breaking in?”

Nia shakes her head, “No. It will never work. The only time they’re not in there is when they’re sleeping and we couldn’t be quiet enough to do it at night. And, I’m not risking it just to find something that might be there. Why would our foster parents have information about our biological parents? You need to find a social worker for that sort of thing. Or you have to figure out a way to read the papers from up here.” Ian gives her look and Nia continues, “Practice, Ian. I know it’s a foreign concept to you, evidenced by the abandoned sports teams, musical instruments, and everything else in your wake. But, the only way you’re going to get better at this is if you practice.”

“How do I do that? It’s not as if there’s a ‘How to see through things for Dummies’ book,” Ian protests.

Nia stands up and goes over to her bookshelf. She grabs a thick book with a leather cover and brings it back to her brother. “Here you go. It’s the next best thing. Take this and don’t come back until you can read what’s on page 159.”

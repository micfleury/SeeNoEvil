Ian is a foster kid. He and his twin sister have been in their current home for as long as they can remember, but they’re told that they were 4 or 5 when they came to live there. Their parents used to be a lot of fun, when they were little, but now they’re very distant--from the twins and from each other. They both work from home and spend the entire day in their locked office. At night, they go to separate bedrooms. Seems like they should divorce, but they’re determined to stay in the same house. 

The twins never want for anything, except affection, of course. Whenever they text/email their parents about anything, money shows up on the kitchen table overnight--clothes, books, field trips, driving lessons--everything is paid for, but sometimes they go weeks without even seeing them. Money for lunch is on the table every day and dinner is delivered every night at 7:30. Life is definitely weird compared to most of their friends, but they don’t know any other fosters, so maybe this is normal. 

Nia wakes Ian up nearly every morning and this one is no different. She calls to him, using a typical endearment (butthead). He opens his eyes and watches her walk over to him. She reaches toward his face and he flinches, assuming she’s going to hit him, but instead she removes a pillow from his face. “You awake under there?” She reaches over and turns off his music. “Why do you have to sleep with this stuff on all night? I can hear all the way in my room.”

Dammit, he thinks. It’s getting worse. He’d started sleeping under a pillow to block out the light. Not just the morning light. All light was too bright for him. It was as if he could see through his own eyelids. Honestly, it was more than like that. It was that. He’d been able to see through his eyelids for about a week and apparently it was getting worse, since he could now see through his pillow. 
“Let’s go,” Nia says and walks out of the room. Ian gets up, gets dressed (including dark sunglasses) and heads downstairs. He’s running late, as always, so he scoops up his bag and lunch money and runs after Nia, who is already exiting out the back door. He doesn’t lock it, assuming that his parents are home, although he hasn’t seen them in 3 days. Ian looks down the road and sees the bus coming, even though it’s at least a half mile away. Nia is walking quickly, but Ian knows they have time so he ambles along.

As he’s walking up to the bus stop, Nia is already there talking with a few friends. Nia is always surrounded by friends. She’s very popular--always seems to know what to say to people. Ian has people he hangs out with at school, but only one real friend...and he’s not on the same bus route. Ian looks across the street at the public bus stop and sees a slim figure leaning up against the shelter. The person is wearing sneakers, jeans, and an oversized hoodie. The hood is pulled over to cover hair, face, everything. As Ian continues to look, the person looks in his direction. Despite the shadows cast by the hood, he can see a face. It’s Nia’s face. It looks just like her. Ian is very confused.

Suddenly, she’s snapping her fingers in front of him. “Hey! Anybody in there? The bus is here.” During this time, the person has turned and headed down the street away from Ian, moving quickly. Ian can still see them. But, he can’t see their face and assumes he must have been confused when Nia stepped in front of him. He turns and climbs on to the bus. He passes by Nia and her friends and takes a seat by himself. 

He leans his head on the seat in front of him and closes his eyes, hoping to get another 20 minutes of sleep before they get to school. Even with his eyes closed, he can still see his feet. But, he sees his bare feet. Great! I forgot to put on shoes! But, just a moment later, he sees through his skin to his skeleton. He looks up to see if anyone else is noticing this. Nia catches his eye and gives him a warm smile. No one else sees him. He puts his head back down and concentrates on clearing his vision. Finally! He doesn’t see his skeleton. Unfortunately, that’s because he doesn’t see anything...except the road passing below them. There is no floor to the bus. 

Ian’s heart is racing because he’s not sure what’s happening. Is he hallucinating? Maybe he just hasn’t been getting enough sleep. That can happen, right? He raises his head and stares at his sister, just waiting for the bus ride to be over, and not wanting to get carsick by staring at the road below. 

When the bus arrives at school, he practically runs off, pushing past people in the other rows. He leans against the bus and bends over, taking a few deep breaths. As the other kids start to file off of the bus, he joins in with the crowd and heads into the school. Everything looks normal again so he heads for his first class. Everything is fine for a while. After lunch, though, he has a test, which he’s not really ready for so he looks at some of the other kids’ tests and scribbles down what he sees. He focuses mostly on the paper of a girl at the front of the room. She aces everything. At first, it confused him that he could see that far away, but now he just accepts it and copies off her more than is probably good.

He hears a soft “ahem” and quickly looks back at his own desk. Nothing on the test makes any sense to him, so he just stares at it. As he stares, he can suddenly see his sneakers. Instead of looking away this time, he continues the stare. His sneakers vanish and then he can see his feet. After another minute, he can see his bones. He starts to hyperventilate. His teacher walks over and asks if he’s okay. When he looks up, all he sees is a skeleton. Frightened, he starts to push back and ends up falling out of his chair. The other kids look up to see what’s going on, and when he looks around the room, he sees a bunch of skulls looking in his direction.

“I don’t...I feel...umm...nurse?” Ian stammers. His skeleton teacher goes back to her desk and tears a pass off of her notepad. Ian has stood up by this point and has his bag over his shoulder. His teacher heads back toward him and her skeleton hand reaches out holding the hall pass. At the nurse’s office, he’s checked for fever, vision problems, low blood sugar...but nothing is wrong. So, the nurse has him lie down for a while.

When he hears the final bell ring, Ian rushes out of the nurse’s office and heads for the quad. He needs to talk to his friend Ben. He’s known Ben for a long time. They used to be neighbors, but a few years ago, they moved to the other side of town. The boys are still very close, despite the geographical distance, so they check in most days. As Ian walks up, Ben is already shouting at him about last night’s episode of ________. Ian holds up his hand to get him to stop and and says to him in a low voice, “Something’s happening.”

“Something? What kind of something? Is it aliens?” Ben is one of those guys who “wants to believe.” Ian starts to explain to him what happened, but hesitates and just tells him that he was able to cheat off a test that was on the other side of the classroom. Ben, who wears really thick glasses still thinks this is really exciting and decides that they have to test it. He starts walking away and Ian asks where he’s going. “The mall, of course.”

Once they’re at the mall, they stop at the food court, because they’re teenage boys and thus always hungry. They eat and plan. While they’re planning, Ben tests Ian’s long-distance vision, constantly interrupting him to point at far away text and asking him to read it. He spots a girl off in the distance and asks Ian what color eyes she has. Ian looks in that direction and it’s not just “some girl,” it’s Nia. She is looking in their direction, but walks another 10 yards or so before she notices that Ben is pointing at her. She freezes and then quickly ducks into the nearest store. 

“That was weird,” Ben says. “Do you think she saw us? So, what color are her eyes?”

“That was Nia, Ben. She has the same color eyes as I do...dark brown,” Ian replies.

“That wasn’t Nia,” Ben protests.

Ian scoffs, “I think I know my own sister.”

“No way. That’s not what she was wearing today at school. Plus, her hair was up, and she’s at least an inch taller than…” Ben trails off. He’s said too much. Ian is gaping at him, but then he just hangs his head and shakes it back and forth. Of course his friend likes Nia. Everybody likes Nia.

Ian moves on from this new revelation to get back to the point that the girl who just ducked into that store has the same face as his sister. And it makes him start to rethink what happened this morning at the bus stop. What he thought was day-dreaming, might have actually been this same girl. He doesn’t tell Ben, however. While his conspiracy theory loving friend would probably love to sink his teeth into something like this, Ian has a feeling that this is just not something to be shared. At least not yet. 

Wanting to move on from his just spilled secret, Ben goes back to finding subjects to test Ian with. He points to a guy in the distance holding a book and asks Ian to tell him the title of the book. While Ian is turning to locate the subject, the guy moves to a kiosk and the book can no longer be seen. “Nevermind,” Ben says and starts to pick out a new target, but Ian answers and tells him the title of the book. “How did you see it?” Ben asks, “There was no time.”

“What do you mean?” Ian responds. “Time for what? I’m looking at the book right now.”

“Yeah, right,” Ben says, “So what color are his sneakers?” Ian tells him they’re blue and Ben does a spit take. “Ian, that guy is standing behind a kiosk. I can only see him from the chest up. Are you telling me that you can see him through the kiosk?”

Ian freezes for a second and then starts to laugh. He points at Ben and says, “Gotcha!” Ben looks embarrassed for a moment and then starts to laugh as well. Once again, Ian is uneasy about sharing with his friend. It should be the coolest thing ever, but it’s just freaking Ian out. While the boys are heading to the trash bin and leaving the food court, the look-alike swiftly walks out of the store she ducked into and takes off in the opposite direction.

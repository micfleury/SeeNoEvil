Ian is sitting in Nia’s room once again, having finally managed to see page 159. Nia is on her bed, with her headphones in, blasting music and trying to ignore him. She hadn’t thought he’d actually manage it, and isn’t pleased to be sharing her room once again. Ian sets his phone to record and focuses on the boxes in the corner. First, he looks into the top box again, trying to identify the things in there. There’s a large cube, a sphere with the top and bottom sliced off, and a twisted wire thing that loops over on itself and sort of makes a triangle. There are no markings on anything and he still can’t figure out what they are. He’ll have to figure out a way to get his hands on them. 

For now, he moves his focus to the bottom box and starts reading aloud so it will be recorded. There are hundreds of pages, each stamped with the name __________________ and featuring the same symbol as that triangle thing in the other box. Several hundred pages are filled with charts with Ian’s and Nia’s names on them. They list dates, times, and scores. Ian doesn’t know what the scores mean, so he keeps searching through the papers until his eyes and head start to hurt. He closes his eyes and lies back. Of course, he can see the ceiling through his own eyelids, so he throws his arm over his face as well.

Nia notices the movement and removes her headphones, leaning forward to look at her brother. “So, did you see anything interesting? Or can we give up this ritual?”

Ian tells her about the objects and about the charts on them, but she doesn’t know what any of it could mean either. She asks again if this means he’s done invading her space. Ian tells her that he’s going to need at least another night to get through the rest of it. He grabs his phone and stands up to leave. As he’s headed to the door, Nia calls out, “What’s a triquetra anyway?”

Ian stops, “A what?”

“A triquetra,” Nia repeats. “You said it while you were reading.”

“No, I didn’t,” Ian protests. “I’ve never even heard that word before.”

Nia rolls her eyes, “I think I know what I heard with my own ears.”
“Your ears that were covered by headphones and being blasted by music?” Ian asks. “Those ears?”

“Whatever,” Nia sighs. “Go listen to your stupid recording. Then I’ll have my proof.”

Of course, when Ian listens to the recording, he never hears that word because he never said it. He never even thought it. 

The next night, when Ian is in his own room trying to organize all of the data he’s seen, he attempts to draw a picture of it. Nia takes the pencil from him and fixes the drawing.

“What did you say this thing is called?” Ian asks her as he watches her draw.

She looks up from the drawing and blinks, trying to recall, “Triquetra? I think.” 

Ian pulls out his phone, “Spell it.” Nia spells it the way she thinks it's spelled and in milliseconds Ian is reading out, “a triangular symmetrical ornament of three interwoven arcs used on metalwork and stone crosses. What could that have to do with us?” 

“What does any of it have to do with us?” Nia counters. “I mean it, Ian. What kind of test scores could they be talking about? Do you remember taking tests?”

Ian shakes his head, “I don’t remember anything from before we lived here. Do you?”

This time it’s Nia’s turn to shake her head, “I don’t think so. Sometimes I think I remember stuff from before we lived here, but none of it makes much sense. So, what do we do next? I vote for sleep.”

“No,” Ian says as he stands up from his desk chair. “I need to do some more reading. I haven’t even looked yet today.”

Nia puts up her hands, “Please, Ian, I know this is important, but I just need my room to myself for one night. Besides, you need the rest, too. Maybe with some sleep, some of this will start to make sense.”

Ian sits back down, a bit defeated, “Yeah, okay. Just one night off, though. Good night.”

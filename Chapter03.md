The next day at school, ignoring his lunch, Ian is instead staring at the cover of the book Nia gave him. Ben walks up and grabs the book out of his hands. “What are you reading? Can you read it if I hold it way over here? Joan of Arc, huh? Do you have a report or something?”

“Nah, Nia just said I should read it. She’s really into Joan of Arc. Fascinated by how she heard voices and stuff.” Ian takes the book back and resumes staring at the cover.

Ben waits a moment and then clears his throat, “Umm...dude. Shouldn’t you open the book if you’re going to read it?”

Ian looks up at Ben, his eyes a bit wet. “Can I tell you something?”

“Of course, you can tell me anything,” Ben says with a look of confusion on his face. He sits down across from Ian. “What is it?”

“Well, obviously, you remember what I said about my vision being really good,” he paused. “It’s more than that. It’s extra good. Like extrasensory. Like, I can see through stuff,” he tells him everything that’s happened up to this point, then looks at his friend with a half smile, waiting for a reply.

Ben looks back at him for a moment still wearing a confused look. Then he smiles back. His smile gets wider and then he’s laughing out loud. “Nice one! You had me for a second.” He continues to laugh, but he looks at Ian and sees that he’s no longer even half smiling. Flustered, he tries to take a swig of his water but can’t seem to swallow and instead just spits it back into the bottle. “What is th...how can y...huh?”

Now Ian does smile. Ben, who looks for the supernatural everywhere, is freaking out when it’s right in front of him. “I don’t know. I don’t know. And huh right back at you. So, now Nia has given me an assignment. I’m supposed to read page 159 of this book without opening it.”

“Yeah, of course, that makes total sense.” Ben has recovered from his shock and is now back in investigator mode. “Nia’s right. You have to learn to manipulate how far you look, or you could end up seeing straight through to nothing at all. Man, she's so smart."

“What?” Ian says, laughing nervously.

“Well, think about it,” Ben says, “If you can’t control how far you’re looking, then you could just end up looking through everything and into space. Dude! Can you do that now? I mean, can you see the earth curving away? How awesome is that?”

Ian shakes his head slowly, “I can’t. I mean, I don’t know if I can, but I’m not really wanting to find out right now...or ever.” What if he looked so far that he couldn’t come back? It would be like living blind. “Right now, I’m just trying to see through the book cover. Nia put a sticky on the first page this morning so I’d have a goal. I’ve seen the table, my shoes, an ant colony about 4 feet underground and once I thought I caught a glimpse of the back cover, but I’m not sure.”

“Hey, maybe it’s like one of those Magic Eye pictures, where you have to focus in front of the actual picture. Maybe you need to try focusing on the front cover, and you’ll just accidentally see through it,” Ben suggests.

Ian tried what Ben suggested. “Idiot,” he laughs.

“You’re an idiot. At least I’m trying to come up with something.” Ben thinks he should leave if Ian is going to be a dick, but decides to cut his friend a break and just digs into his lunch instead.

“No!” Ian protested, never breaking his gaze from the book. “You’re NOT an idiot. That’s what the note says. I saw it. Your trick worked.” He stares for a few more minutes trying to get to page 159 but only ends up looking at the back cover. Frustrated, he pushes the book away and starts in on his lunch.

“Don’t give up, man. You’ll get there. In the meantime, though, how can we exploit this?” Ben grins.

The boys talk about what Ian can do with his new found power. Obviously, their first thoughts go to the girls’ locker room--they are teenagers, after all--but Ian refuses. Having a twin sister can sometimes help a boy be less of a pig. Getting the answers to the next chemistry exam sounds like a good idea, but until he can figure out how to read individual pages, it’s not likely. Eventually, they settle on gambling. By this point, several other boys have joined the lunch table.

“Hey Brody!” Ian calls. “What have you got for lunch? Wait...don’t tell me. I’ll guess.” Ian lists off all of the contents of Brody’s bag.

“Ha!” Brody says. “Lucky guess. That’s what I eat every day anyway.” 

Ian shrugs and gives a half smile, “I can do it again. Any takers?”

Another boy agrees. Ian tells him that it has to be a dollar wager. The boy takes the bet. Again, Ian is able to list off everything in the lunch bag. The boy is rather astonished and looking for how Ian might have cheated, including checking to see if Ben is giving any signals. In the end, all he can do is hand over the dollar. Ian tries it with a couple other of the boys at the table. He’s right every time and they start insisting that he tell them how he does it. He can’t come up with anything, so he shoots a look at Ben who pretends to take a phone call and walks away from the table. On the next round, he gets a couple of items wrong on purpose. The boys conclude that there was some sort of signaling happening between Ian and Ben and demand their money back. Ian protests for a moment, “Hey...I didn’t say I’d *guess* what was in there, just that I’d *tell* you,” but relents and gives them back their money.

Later, after school, Ben and Ian are hanging out in the quad and Ian thanks Ben for saving him. “I don’t know why it’s important that it’s a secret. I just feel like it is.” Ben agrees and they are quiet and serious for a moment. Suddenly Ben looks up and grins, “We can still have fun, though, right? Just secret fun…”

“What are you thinking?” Ian asks warily. Ben winks.
